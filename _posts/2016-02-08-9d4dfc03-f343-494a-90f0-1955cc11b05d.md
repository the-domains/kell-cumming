## INTELLIGENCE AS A BUSINESS FUNCTION
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/af9b4e19-eae0-44d2-8cae-19fbbe69071a.png)

Strategic business decisions should be based on
the significant facts affecting these decisions.
This was true when Mr. Sloan was running
General Motors from 1923 until 1946; nowadays
it is even more important as the changing world
is speeding up every day. 

These influencing factors can originate inside a
business or its environment. In addition, the
strategic decisions can be affected by factors,
which are (sometimes) out of the control of the
decision makers. Having information on all
efficacious factors available should make good
strategic decisions. It is very important to have
specialists taking care of the organization and
the presentation of important facts.
Intelligence, as a corporate-level function,
should allow the timely and effective
application of resources that provide a benefit
to our customers, that our competitors can't match. Intelligence should contribute to the
company overall strategy, not only to managing
a crisis. 

Intelligence in the corporate environment
should be a systematic program for gathering
and analyzing information about competitors,
regulators and other stakeholders; about their
activities and general trends, to further our own
company's goals.
The Intelligence Process supports the efforts of
Strategic Planning and delivers input for the
decision-making processes involved. Strategic
Planning is not possible without the right
intelligence.
