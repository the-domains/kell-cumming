## INTELLIGENCE IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

_Intelligence, as a corporate-level function, allows the
timely and effective application of resources that provide a benefit to our
client's customers, that our client's competitors can't match._

_We don't believe in the application of the intelligence
craft for managing only corporate risk agendas, but rather as a strategic
advantage or edge._

_Intelligence should contribute to the company overall
strategy, not only to managing crisis. Kell-Cumming helps clients to establish
corporate intelligence divisions and assist them in developing policies and
processes when they don't exist. We can also provide intelligence gathering and
analysis as an outsourced corporate function._
